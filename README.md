## Backend

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides the REST API endpoints. It's located in the `backend/` directory.

### Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
4. Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
5. Start the server: `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React and is located in the `frontend/` directory. It contains:
- Admin Dashboard: A React application for managing the platform

### Setup
1. Navigate to the specific frontend application directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Development

- Backend API runs on: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend development server runs on: http://localhost:3000
- API documentation available at: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Features

- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª **Swedish Data Residency**: All data processing and storage within Sweden (Bahnhof Cloud)
- ðŸ”’ **Security First**: Built-in authentication, rate limiting, and data encryption
- ðŸš€ **Developer Friendly**: Simple SDKs and clear documentation
- âš¡ **High Performance**: Optimized inference with failover support
- ðŸ“Š **Full Monitoring**: Comprehensive admin and customer dashboards

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The platform implements a comprehensive role-based access control system with the following roles:

### Roles & Permissions

1. **Guest** (Not signed in)
   - Can access public documentation
   - No access to authenticated API endpoints
   - No portal or account management features

2. **User**
   - Access personal usage & account details
   - Use the PeerAI API with their own API keys
   - View personal usage logs and tokens consumed

3. **User Admin** (Customer Admin)
   - Everything a User can do
   - Manage team-level billing details
   - Manage team memberships (invite/remove users)
   - View team usage statistics
   - Cannot manage other teams or create super admins

4. **Super Admin** (Peer Digital Admin)
   - Full system access
   - Manage any team or user
   - Access system-wide analytics and configuration
   - Reserved for Peer Digital staff

### API Endpoints

RBAC-related endpoints are available under `/api/v1/rbac/`:

- `POST /teams` - Create a new team (User Admin+)
- `GET /teams/{team_id}` - Get team details (Team members)
- `PUT /users/{user_id}/role` - Update user role (User Admin+)
- `POST /teams/{team_id}/members/{user_id}` - Add user to team (User Admin+)
- `DELETE /teams/members/{user_id}` - Remove user from team (User Admin+)
- `GET /teams/{team_id}/members` - List team members (User Admin+)

### Implementation Status

> **Note:** Team management and RBAC functionality is partially implemented. The database models and core services are in place, but some API routes and UI components are still in development. The `TeamManagement.tsx` component contains UI placeholders, but the backend integration is not yet complete. This feature is planned for the next release.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- PostgreSQL 15 or higher
- macOS (ARM/Intel) or Linux

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peerdigital/peerai.git
cd peerai
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# Install all dependencies including development tools
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. **Initialize the database**
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

5. **Start the development server**
```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running Tests

The project uses PostgreSQL for both development and testing environments. Before running tests:

1. **Create a test database**
```bash
createdb peerai_test
```

2. **Configure test database**
```bash
# In your .env file, set the test database URL:
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/peerai_test
```

3. **Run tests**
```bash
pytest
```

The test suite uses a separate PostgreSQL database to ensure isolation from your development environment. Each test runs in a transaction that is rolled back after the test completes.
